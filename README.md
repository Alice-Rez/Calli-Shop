# Calli-Shop

Mock up of the e-shop selling calligraphies - project created at the end of the React module of my one year web development course.

App state management is done using by Redux, for styling were used Styled Components. Calligraphies are my own handwork (all rights reserved!), just scanned and transformed to SVG.
